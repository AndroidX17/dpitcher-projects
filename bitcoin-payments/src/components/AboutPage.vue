      <p> This is Mortality Core's payment and shop system.</p>

<p>Everyone gets a personal deposit address when you first log in. If you send bitcoin to this address it will be reflected on your account in 10 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Please treat all items in the shop as tips right now as we don't have any real products to offer.</p>

<p>You can track your payments if you have your transaction hash</p>


<p>The Fall of Reason game is not a complete or released game, and so while we value any feedback from early testing, we cannot provide refunds for any payments to the shop.</p>
